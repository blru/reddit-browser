# My first VUEJS project - A Reddit Browser

This is a Reddit browser I made as a first project to learn vue. All in all this took around 8 hours over 1 day to build.

## Features

-   Searching for subreddits
-   Filtering posts by daily, weekly, monthly, yearly & all
-   Basic media & stats displaying

## TODO

Possible improvements:

-   [ ] Better media support (images, videos, etc)
-   [x] Infinite Scrolling
-   [ ] Full-search functionality
-   [ ] Viewing comments & awards
-   [x] Post rendering markdown support

> âš  This may break in the near future due to reddit's controversial 2023 API policy changes.
